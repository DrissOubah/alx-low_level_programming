Tasks 0 and 1 are programming tasks related to implementing and testing search algorithms, while Tasks 2 to 6 involve analyzing the time and space complexities of various algorithms.

Task 0 requires implementing a linear search algorithm in C. It defines a function linear_search that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm. The function prototype is provided along with instructions on how the function should behave, including printing the values checked during the search. The task includes a sample main program to test the function with various inputs.

Task 1 involves implementing a binary search algorithm in C. Similar to Task 0, it defines a function binary_search to search for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm. The function prototype and behavior requirements are provided, including printing the array being searched at each step. A sample main program is provided to test the function with different inputs.

Tasks 2 and 3 are theoretical questions related to algorithm analysis (Big O notation). Task 2 asks about the time complexity (worst case) of a linear search in an array of size n, while Task 3 asks about the space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n.

Tasks 4 and 5 are also theoretical questions related to algorithm analysis, focusing on binary search. Task 4 asks about the time complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n, while Task 5 asks about the space complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n.

Task 6 involves analyzing the space complexity of a given function or algorithm. It provides a function allocate_map that dynamically allocates memory for a 2D array and asks about its space complexity.
